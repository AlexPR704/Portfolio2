        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to come view my portfolio page as I stated before my name is Alexander
            Garcia.
            I am 26 years old and I am currently living in Gastonia, NC. I am currently attending UNCC Full Stack
            Developer Bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p>The reason for me to begin this journey to become a full stack developer is because I wanted a change
            that reflects me.
            I have been managing for over 8 years in the food service industry and also owned a Flowers bakery
            route. There has always
            been problems that needs to be resolved. What I have coime to find out is that I do enjoy being a
            problem solver.</p>
        <p>
            I wanted to be able to go to a path that will feel rewarding when a problem is solved. You feel such a
            huge accomplishment for it.
            I have had a love for computers in high school and explored but never dove into more. My passion has
            always been in my heart but
            I have recently deciding to take control and change my future. Please feel free to check out my
            portfolio and to contact me for anything.
        </p>
