# Dynamic Portfolio
My motivation for recreating this portfolio is to demonstrate what I have learned from so far from this course.  
My portfolio shows I am able to a dynamic portfolio and ensure that it is reponsive. I want to be able to show future employers that I will work hard to try to achieve the task on hand.
In the future I hope to improve on this portfolio to make it more polished than the last. The GOAL is to always be better than before and never quit.
# Usage
This portfolio will be used to showcase my skills to future employers. Also it is a way that I am able to connect with others.
# Credits
Special credit goes to the team of instructors. Without their help; this portfolio wouldn't have been possible. Also with the help of Stackoverflow. Great community waiting to help.
